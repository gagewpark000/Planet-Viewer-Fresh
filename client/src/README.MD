Planet Viewer is used to interact with a live client-side application connecting to a Postgres database called SolarSystemGeek!
The website functions as a planet viewer, while when logged in, the user may add planets to the database through the client side, as well as delete planets from it.
This application uses React with functional components by use of routes, Navlinks, etc for smooth client-side navigation.
